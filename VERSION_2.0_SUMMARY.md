# Version 2.0 - Complete Summary

## 🎉 What's New in Version 2.0

This major update transforms the Design System Checker into a comprehensive tool for both connecting to existing styles AND creating new ones.

---

## 🎨 Major Features

### 1. Create New Styles
The biggest addition! Now you can create new styles directly from unconnected elements.

**How to use:**
- Click the purple **"✨ Create"** button on any element
- Enter a style name (suggested names provided)
- New style is created with all element properties
- Style is automatically applied to the element

**What gets created:**
- **Text Styles**: Font family, size, weight, line height, letter spacing, and more
- **Color Styles**: Paint styles for fills and strokes with exact colors

### 2. Enhanced Visual Dropdowns
Dropdowns now show rich visual information:

**For Colors:**
- 16×16px color preview thumbnails
- Easier to identify the right color at a glance
- Color variables marked with 🎨 emoji

**For Text Styles:**
- Font size displayed under style name (e.g., "24px")
- Two-line layout for better readability
- Instant visual scanning

### 3. Improved Typography Matching
More intelligent matching that catches common mistakes:

**Better at finding:**
- Elements with correct size but wrong font (now 20-40% match instead of 0%)
- Similar font weights (400 vs 500 treated as close)
- Near-match sizes (within 2px considered same)

**Lower threshold:**
- Shows matches above 20% (was 60%)
- Helps surface potential matches that were hidden before

### 4. Larger Window
- **Before**: 700×700px
- **After**: 1000×850px
- **Benefit**: More comfortable viewing, less scrolling
